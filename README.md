# Chat-with-webs

## Project Overview
The project aims to create a chat interface that utilizes the power of Langchain and Open AI APIs to facilitate a conversation based on a provided website article. The user can input the website address of an article, and the chat interface will generate a context-based conversation based on the article's content. This will allow users to engage with the article's information in a more interactive and conversational manner.
